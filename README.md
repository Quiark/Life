# Life

This is a personal 'social network' - a place where you can share your life experiences with
your closest people. It is completely hosted and owned by you, without advertising, privacy
leaks or manipulation by advertisers or platform.

In short it is your **Life** and yours only.

This software is 

* **PRIVATE** - no public posts are supported (but you are still trusting your cloud provider)
* **NOT SCALABLE** - it's not about increasing engagement or having as many friends as possible
